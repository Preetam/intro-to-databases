Introduction to (Relational) Databases
==================

Getting started
---
1. Get Python
2. Clone this repository
3. Do the exercises (they're fill-in-the-blank)

Each example is in its own test case. You'll have to use the following to
run each of them individually:

```sh
python -m unittest.exercises.E.test_exercise_1
```

For exercise 2, use the following:

```sh
python -m unittest.exercises.E.test_exercise_2
```

and so on.
